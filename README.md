### Overall description 
This simple program combines the Twitter Stream API and Twitter Search REST API. Once started, it can retrieve both real-time geotagged tweets from that starting point of time as well as the tweets posted 7 days before. After all the tweets are retrieved (which are saved in two separate files), the program provides a function to combine the retrieved tweets and remove duplicated ones.
